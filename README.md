ML-KNN-IRIS-PROJECT: Classification of Iris Species
This repository contains the required files for the Machine Learning Project report, focusing on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to:

Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using the public Iris dataset.

Utilize K-Fold Cross-Validation to select the optimal hyperparameter K (number of neighbors).

Evaluate the final model's generalization performance on an independent, held-out test set.

Project Artifact
All project documentation, code execution, visualizations (PairPlot, CV curve), and final results are contained within the main Jupyter Notebook file:

Key Results
The model achieved highly successful results due to the clean and separable nature of the Iris dataset:

Optimal Hyperparameter (K): 5

Best CV Accuracy: â‰ˆ98.3%

Independent Test Accuracy: 100.0%

Environment: Python 3.x, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, scikit-learn.
